This is just a simple test file. Nothing crazy to see here.
I bought my Mac on Craigslist. I found it at 2am for $200. The previous owner was a young lady who'd bought a newer Mac, but this was her first, and she nearly cried when I left with.

It's too slow, so I have a big, honking Hackintosh with 16 gigs ram at home.
